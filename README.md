## Loan Default Prediction
### Description
Banks derive a significant portion of their revenue from providing loans, but this practice is often accompanied by the inherent risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans. In order to address this issue, banks have made the decision to leverage Machine Learning as a solution. They have amassed a vast dataset containing historical information about loan borrowers and are seeking assistance in creating a robust ML model capable of categorizing whether a new borrower is likely to default on their loan or not.

The dataset is extensive and encompasses various deterministic factors such as the borrower's income, gender, loan purpose, among others. This dataset exhibits strong multicollinearity among variables, and it may also contain missing data. The challenge is to overcome these obstacles and construct a powerful classifier to predict loan defaulters.


### Objective
Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and conduct necessary data cleanup if required.
Develop a classification model for predicting whether a loan borrower is likely to default or not.
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model and compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms to ensure the best predictive performance.
